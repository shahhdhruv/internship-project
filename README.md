# Credit Card Default Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting credit card defaults using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is the "Credit Card Default" dataset from Ineuron, which contains information about credit card holders and whether they defaulted on their payments.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict whether a credit card holder is likely to default on their payments based on the given features.

## Data
The dataset contains the following features:
- ID: Unique identifier for each credit card holder
- LIMIT_BAL: Credit limit
- SEX: Gender of the cardholder
- EDUCATION: Level of education
- MARRIAGE: Marital status
- AGE: Age of the cardholder
- PAY_0 to PAY_6: Payment status from April to September
- BILL_AMT1 to BILL_AMT6: Bill amount from April to September
- PAY_AMT1 to PAY_AMT6: Payment amount from April to September
- DEFAULT: Target variable indicating whether the cardholder defaulted (1) or not (0)


## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/shahhdhruv/credit-card-default-prediction.git`
